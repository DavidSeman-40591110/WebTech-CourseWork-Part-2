            Tim and Tracey have a channel about going to places with alien aura to them.
            Their small organization 'UFO Seekers®' do explorations into the environments
            and how to get a closer view into the Nevada dessert acording to this website.

            It was very brave and informative video. Tim talks about how they got there, where you are and not allowed
            to go.
            Beutifull landscape of nature outdoors. Shots of night sky while imagining it to be UFOs.
            Tim and Tracey show that they are a mountain hiking type.
            <br>
            The most important part of the video that most people are interested anyway happens on 14:10 time mark.

            Camera takes the first look at the base.

            This video is much more quiter and shorter than the one above.
            At 00:07 time mark, you can faintly hear someone calling out for help.
            So I do recommend to have headphones and increase your volume slightly but remember.
            After you finish the video, make sure to lower your volume back down incase you click on something new
            that makes a sound that will be louder than you expect.
            It's very puzzling what this means, comments think it's the guards pulling a prank.
            <br>
            But calling for false help hasen't been populr at the time of the video was uploaded (8th October 2021).
            But still is funny that USA's CIA department has a website how all rumors and conspiracies aren't true about
            this base.
            Check out CIA's website <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
                href="https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/ask-molly-what-really-went-on-at-area-51/">here</a>.
            Also who is Molly? probably just propaganda machine.
            Even if their are no aliens, no green men and no magicall metals that fallen from the sky.
            Shouldn't people have the right to know what their governments are doing?
            <br>
            Where is their tax money going? if not for the roads and healthcare.
            There are many things American Nationals aren't paying in taxes
