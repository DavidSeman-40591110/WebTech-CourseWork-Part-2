        <h2>Thank You For Visitng My Website</h2>
        <p id="Paragraph-block2">
            Let this site inspire you to look more into these topics I cover here.
            <br>

            Of course this is all just the surface of this Iceberg.
            There is a lot more that can potentially be covered on Area 51, many information
            we have from many different types of people on Aliens.
            <br>
            <br>
            Human history and understanding of our authorities and our society.
            I understand there is so much more to cover but as a University project.
            <br>
            <br>
            Time constraints have made me to reduce certain features I wanted to implement.
            <br>
            However I just couldn't see how I will realisticlly be able to implement them
            in desired time.
            <br>
            <br>
            I still thank you for checking out my site,
            <br>
            I hope I can keep the source code
            for this whole website to potentially exapnd it further outside of University.
