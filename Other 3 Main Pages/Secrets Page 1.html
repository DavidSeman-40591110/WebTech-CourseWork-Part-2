            Shows the closest place someone managed to get to the Base.
            <br>
            You just have to go further south-west of the road-
            <br>
            -you are seeing and hopefull run into the real Base itself.
            <br>
            It wasn't untill just 2013, did the Authorities admitted that there is a Military Base in that Dessert.
            <br>
            But nothing else or what happenings or work occures there.
            <br>
            So there was a time when many poeple who investigated, looked for it and found that such base exists.
            <br>
            But authorities stright up denied of existance of it.

                Richard Leiby still has an old article about it.</a>
            <br>
            Talks about the ways authorities avoided to answer on existance of this Base.

        Silence from authorities was only broken when the USA's environmental laws
        <br>
        came to effect and workers were complaining about workplace health and safety.
        <br>
        But this only aroused more thinking about what could be happening in that Base.
