            You pick yourself up and approach the window to get a good look outside.
            <br>
            You freeze for a momment as your brain refuses to trust what it sees.
            <br>
            Your body's movement is frozen like a shocked out goat.
            What you see is a sort of entity with a humanoid shape but it's not human.
            Not clearly it has something that looks like eyes but irises are
            <br>
            pitch black that it's hard tell to the direction where this "thing" is looking at.
            <br>
            You can see a curved line below those eyes but they aren't moving.
            <br>
            As far as you can tell, that's the only parts
            of it's face you can see but the rest of its body.
            <br>
            Is just a wierd shade of green colour.
            Above the house you witness some circular dance of glowing lights.
            <br>
            It's little glowing dots make the shape of a plate
            that was blown air into the middle of the said plate.
            <br>
            However the loud noise was coming from the house
            and not from those anomalies. As you take in what you see,
            <br>
            you manage to break yourself free from that frozen state.
            <br>
            Shock has tunred to panic and stress as you look around your room to decide what to do.
            <br>
            Your Dog is upstairs and your car is right outside the door that you see from your living room.
            <br>
            Can you call the police on this?
            <br>
            <br>
            What are you gonna do next?
