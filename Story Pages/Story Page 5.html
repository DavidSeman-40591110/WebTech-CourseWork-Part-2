            You run upstairs to get your dog Sid. He is a Basset Hound breed. So he will need help to get down stairs.
            <br>
            Your eyes get blocked by an intense light coming from windows so through hearing and touch.
            <br>
            You reach the room Sid was barking from. You pick him up and hurry down stairs.
            <br>
            Those noises are making your dog scared to go outside so you open your car with your wireless key,
            <br>
            pick up Sid again and place him at the back seat while you start the car with rush of adrenaline.
            <br>
            You drive off your place and into the night. Glancing as the lights from the sky slowly fade away from your
            mirrors.
