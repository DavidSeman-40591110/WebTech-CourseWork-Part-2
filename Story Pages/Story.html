            You are alone at home after what feels like long hours of work. It was busy today, it's always during the
            festivities.
            <br>
            Just want to relax and lay about since that's the type of break you need after long days of work.
            <br>
            Also it's finally weekend.
            <br>Taking off your shoes, take your jacket and everything from your work bag.
            <br>Put all your things to your place because weekend has started.
            <br>
            As you are about to sit on your couch to finally let the TV take your mind off.
            <br>
            You hear a strange sound coming from outside.
            <br>
            "Is the neighbor doing something new this evening?" you think to your self.
            <br>
            It's not unusual for your neighbor to make some noise with his generator.
            <br>
            But this one just sounded, off.
            <br>
            It gets louder that you just can't hear over the TV anymore.
            <br>
            But there is something uncanny about those noises.
            You just can't really click with what it could be.
            <br>
            It's already pass the time when the people are supposed to be quit.
            <br>
            You could call the authorities but also you kind of want to see what exactly is your neighbor doing.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            What should you do?
