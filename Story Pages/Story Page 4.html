            You have escaped from the Xenos, you have escaped for now. You go of to search for a safe place.
            <br>
            As far as your fuel can allow while looking through your map to rest somewhere.
            <br>
            Your life will just never be the sames since why would anyone believe what you saw.
            <br>

            <br>
            You find your self a place afforable to stay for a few nights since you need some time to really think over
            what you have experienced.

            <br>

            Thoughts of the possibility make your body slightly twitch. With struggle you do atleast fall asleep.
